### Overview

LK Photo Day ("PASTEL MUSE") is a single Next.js 16 landing page for a one-day photo event in Warsaw. It has no database, no Docker, and no microservices. The only backend logic is a `POST /api/book` route that sends notifications via Resend email and Telegram bot.

### Commands

Standard commands are in `package.json`:

- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` (starts on port 3000)
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Build:** `npm run build`

### Caveats

- **Pre-existing lint errors:** ESLint reports 2 errors and 2 warnings in `experience-title.tsx` and `pastel-muse-experience.tsx` (React hooks rules). These are pre-existing in the codebase and not caused by setup.
- **Environment variables for form submission:** The booking form (`POST /api/book`) requires `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BOOKING_EMAIL_TO`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env.local`. Without these, the landing page renders and works fine, but form submission returns a 500 error. This is expected behavior in local dev without API keys.
- **Content language:** The site copy is in Russian (Cyrillic). The form labels and buttons are in Russian.
